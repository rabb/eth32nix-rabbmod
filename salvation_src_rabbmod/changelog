*Credits for this release:
 -Alexplay
 -ELITE_x
 -rabbit
 -LeAkeR

-Fixed Gentity ESP colors.

-Added timenudge & snaps unlocker (they can now be used in any server with any value, even on ETPro - Can be turned on/off)

-Improved chams menu and customization (2 Custom shaders (normal and outline) for Players, weapons and items, each with custom color and toggleable wallhack)
-Changed etproOs cvar to spoofOs and added it to the menu (Now true = win32 and false = linux)
-Fixed aimpoints size for contour trace and number of head and body points are now auto (Aimbot should be a bit better against hiders)
-Fixed muzzlePoint for other mods (Aim should be a LOT better now at different heights in non etpub servers)
-Improved sequential spree sounds (Spree sounds will keep playing if current spree is > 35 and each 5 kills)
-Fixed Aimbot.Respawn() not being called in jaymod.
-Raised frequency from 127 to 230 in CSyscall.S_StartLocalSound (Louder hitsounds and spreesounds)

-Improved aimpoints visualization and they're PBSS proof now. 
-More sophisticated hitbox tracing with different aimpoints for head and body + 2 new traces (Static and X Trace, last one is rsHook based and very CPU hungry)
-Moved Color Picker to a new section, increased its size and added custom colors for:
 -Missiles ESP (Grenades, etc.)

-Fixed a bug where having enabled riflebot wouldn't enable it for real unless you enabled grenade bot.
-The hack will now run on 2.60b if compiled with GCC >= 4.4.0. The only drawback is that you need to put your pk3 file in ~/.etwolf/etmain from now on, it'll work exactly the same way.
